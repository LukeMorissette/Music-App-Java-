# Music Application Project

A Java-based application that simulates a simple music streaming service using object-oriented programming principles. It features several classes—`Account`, `Listener`, `Content`, `Podcast`, `Playlist`, `Album`, and `MusicAppDriver`—that work together to manage users, playlists, favorites, and more. The program also generates a `Favorites.txt` file containing a listener’s favorite content, sorted by streams.

3. **Text File** – The program will create a `Favorites.txt` file when exporting a listener’s favorite content.
